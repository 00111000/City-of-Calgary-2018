# ART++ :phone: :movie_camera: :art:

> You can find more details about the pedestrian comfort theme in our FAQs, but in a nutshell, we’re looking for participants to create something that falls into one of the three categories of pedestrian comfort: play, safety and health.

- **Play: Create something that helps people use our streets in a new ways and encourages community.**
- Safety: Create something that helps increase pedestrian safety on Calgary’s streets.
- Health: Create something that helps encourage Calgarians to get outside and be active.
